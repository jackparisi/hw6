Weather Dashboard:
    For my homework I made this web page that gives the current day's weather and a five day forecast. If you search any city in the search bar you are presented with the current day's weather as well as a brief five day forecast. When you search a new city you are presented with the same info but for that location and the first searched city is placed into the search history underneath the search bar. If you click on any of the cities in the search history you will be presented with that city's weather again. For this page I used the WeatherMap API to retrieve all of the weather information. Each section required different API documentation to retrieve the right information. I used jquery for all of my DOM manipulation and I used moment.js to retrieve the current date. For my styling I mostly used the bootstrap library with my own css mixed in.
